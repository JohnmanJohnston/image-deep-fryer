# image-deep-fryer
A simple tool to deep fry your images, for fun.

It starts with a simple prompt, asking you to upload a file for it to deep fry.
Then, you have some customizable parametersâ€”you can customize the brightness, contrast, saturation, hue-rotation, and inversion of colors of the image you uploaded.
You can use the customizable parameters to get a combination that you like, and then you can view your ~~scuffed~~ beautiful deep fried image.
